Moov Identity is a RESTful API for managing users that can interact with the system. It handles the last piece of authentication converting an authentication session into an authenticated session that can be used for checking authorization.

## Project Status

This project is currently under development and could introduce breaking changes to reach a stable status. We are looking for community feedback so please try out our code or give us feedback!

## Getting Started

Identity can be ran various ways via docker or running locally. However you will have to disable to gateway's authentication's to send requests.

More tutorials to come on how to use this as other pieces required to handle authorization are in place!

- [Using docker-compose](#local-development)
- [Using our Docker image](#docker-image)

No configuration is required to serve on `:8200` and metrics at `:8201/metrics` in Prometheus format.

### Docker image

You can download [our docker image `moov/identity`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/identity/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. 

### Local Development

```
make run
```

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moov-io/ach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started! Checkout our [issues for first time contributors](https://github.com/moov-io/identity/contribute) for something to help out with.

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go 1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/identity/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions (or [contributing and running fuzzers](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)).

Tests can run processes (like sqlite databases), but should only do so locally.
